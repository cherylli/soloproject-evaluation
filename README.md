### Project Evaluation Results

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Passed | Hi @. Congratulations on your hard work and dedication. Your Voyage 45 Solo Project has been accepted and you are advancing to the Voyage Phase starting on August 7th. Watch the <#1026584387569078373> channel for more information. <br/><br/> ```**_If you haven't yet signed up for Voyage 45 complete this form so you don't miss out _** ``` —> https://forms.gle/DajSfXQCX4qbMAu8A <br/><br/>I’m looking forward to seeing what you and your team will be creating in your Voyage! <br/><br/>https://c.tenor.com/bDxOr4tSm7kAAAAC/spongebob-high-five.gif <br/><br/>Here is some more specific feedback which I hope will be helpful: |
| Requested changes | Hi @. Your app shows that you’ve invested a considerable amount of thought and effort in its design & implementation. <br/><br/>Please make the following change and then DM me here when you are ready for me to look at it again. ``` **_This is the only change you are required to make._** ``` <br/><br/>* Requested change #1… <br/><br/>Here’s additional feedback that I hope will be helpful. |
| Requested changes - no deployed URL | I started to review your Solo Project, but you haven’t provided a valid URL for where it’s deployed on the Internet. <br/><br/>We ask for this so we can not only look at your code, but also the running application and it’s UI/UX. In addition, knowing how to deploy to a web host like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Render, etc. is a skill you’ll need in your Voyage. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
| Repo URL not found |	I started to review your Solo Project, but the URL you’ve provided for your repo is not found (HTTP/404). <br/><br/>This often happens if the repo is marked as private in GitHub instead of public. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |

### Tier

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| App doesn’t match selected tier | ```* This Solo Project is a Tier 2, rather than a Tier 3 app, so you are eligible to join the next Voyage as a Tier 2 participant. You can learn more about our tiers and the requirements of each here —> https://chingucohorts.notion.site/Solo-Projects-2a41ff900cc24a72a919f0eb5e79c42b``` |

|-----------|----------|
| Good readme | ```* Your repo includes a good readme. Here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme. You can use this to improve your readme in future projects https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d.``` |
| No readme | ```* You haven’t included a readme in your repo. This is a critical part of any project and here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme.  https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d.``` |
| Readme needs improvement | ```* Your repo contains a readme that could be even better with a few changes.  This is an important part of any project and here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme.  https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d.``` |
| Good readme, but no screenshot/gif | ```* Your readme is good, but could be even better with the addition of a screenshot/gif.  Here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme. You can use this to improve your readme in future projects https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d. ```|
| Readme is generated by a utility | ```* Your readme is the template generated by CRA and could be improved. Here’s additional info to show how to structure a well written readme.

### Commits

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Commits are atomic & commit messages are descriptive | ```* Your commits are atomic and your commit messages are descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Commits are atomic, but commit messages aren’t descriptive | ```* Your commits are atomic, but some commit messages could be more descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Commits aren’t atomic, but commit messages are descriptive | ```* Your commits aren’t atomic, but your commit messages are descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Commits aren’t atomic and commit messages aren’t descriptive | ```* Your commits aren’t atomic and your commit messages could be more descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Files have been uploaded to GitHub rather than by using git | ```* Changes appear to be made directly to GitHub using file uploads. Suggest using git so individual commits/changes can be tracked. Here’s more information on how to use git & GitHub to provide better tracking and change management. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git``` |

### Repo

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Repo is well organized | ```* Your repo is well organized. This is very important since you'll spend more time maintaining an app than writing it. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2. ``` |
| Source code not in `src` directory | ```* I suggest you look at adding source code files to a `src` directory in the root of your repo in future projects. This has little benefit on a project of this size, but for more projects with many source files the organization it adds will make understanding the app easier. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2``` |
| Repo is well organized, but no separate BE & FE subdirectories | ```* Your repo is well organized. But, you can make it even better by adding a `backend` subdirectory for your BE code and a `frontend` subdirectory for your FE code. This is very important since you'll spend more time maintaining an app than writing it. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2. ``` |
| Repo is well organized, but source code is included in a directory that should be merged into the root of the repo | ```* I suggest you move the source code files in the `` directory into the root of your repo in future projects. This directory currently adds an extra, unnecessary directory level to the project and moving it will make understanding the app easier. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2``` |
| Image files not in their own subdirectory	| ```* You can make your repo even more organized by moving your image files into their own subdirectory. For example, `images`.``` |
| Configuration files not in their own subdirectory	| ```* You can make your repo even more organized by moving your configuration files, such as site.webmanifest, into their own subdirectory. For example, assets.``` |
| Additional src file organization required	| ```* You should consider improving the organization of your repo by creating additional subdirectories under the src directory for specific types of functionality. For example, a components subdirectory for page components. This will help you and any contributors to the project quickly and easily locate specific types of files based on their usage.``` |
| `node_modules` directory included in GitHub repo | ```* I suggest adding `node_modules` to `.gitignore` to reduce GitHub repo size. Since this subdirectory is build and managed by NPM from your `package.json` file there’s no advantage to including it in GitHub. However, this is merely a best practice and doesn’t impact how the application runs.``` |
| Update package.json to move `devDependencies` to be adjacent to `dependencies` | ```* In your `package.json` file consider moving `devDependencies` to be adjacent to `dependencies`. This is a minor change, but since the two need to be examined together during troubleshooting it’s something that could be a timesaver.``` |
| Packages are embedded in repo | ```* There are several libraries, like `popper.js` embedded in the repo which will greatly increase bundle size. Consider using a bundler like NPM or versions hosted on CDN's to improve initial page load time. This will also let you take advantage of any fixes and changes made by the vendor without having to redeploy your app. However, it does increase the risk of a breaking change impacting your code.``` |
| Code embedded as script in HTML file | ```* Javascript code is embedded in your HTML file as a <script>. It’s actually a best practice to include code as a separate file that’s referenced by a <script> tag, rather than embedding the code itself. Here’s information describing the situation in detail and how to deal with it https://www.thoughtco.com/moving-javascript-out-of-the-web-page-2037542``` |
| `.env` file included in GitHub repo | ```* App secrets are exposed in plaintext in the `.env` file. A best practice to follow is to add this file to your `.gitignore` so it’s not uploaded to GitHub. https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa ``` |

| Consider adding professional & social links | ```* Consider adding your social & professional links, like GitHub, Twitter, & LinkedIn, to your webpage. This is especially important if you’ll be sharing this app with potential employers. You want to make it easy for them to learn more about you.``` |
