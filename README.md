### Project Evaluation Results

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Passed | Hi @. Congratulations on your hard work and dedication. Your Voyage 45 Solo Project has been accepted and you are advancing to the Voyage Phase starting on August 7th. Watch the <#1026584387569078373> channel for more information. <br/><br/> ```**_If you haven't yet signed up for Voyage 45 complete this form so you don't miss out _** ``` —> https://forms.gle/DajSfXQCX4qbMAu8A <br/><br/>I’m looking forward to seeing what you and your team will be creating in your Voyage! <br/><br/>https://c.tenor.com/bDxOr4tSm7kAAAAC/spongebob-high-five.gif <br/><br/>Here is some more specific feedback which I hope will be helpful: |
| Requested changes | Hi @. Your app shows that you’ve invested a considerable amount of thought and effort in its design & implementation. <br/><br/>Please make the following change and then DM me here when you are ready for me to look at it again. ``` **_This is the only change you are required to make._** ``` <br/><br/>* Requested change #1… <br/><br/>Here’s additional feedback that I hope will be helpful. |
| Requested changes - no deployed URL | I started to review your Solo Project, but you haven’t provided a valid URL for where it’s deployed on the Internet. <br/><br/>We ask for this so we can not only look at your code, but also the running application and it’s UI/UX. In addition, knowing how to deploy to a web host like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Render, etc. is a skill you’ll need in your Voyage. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
| Repo URL not found |	I started to review your Solo Project, but the URL you’ve provided for your repo is not found (HTTP/404). <br/><br/>This often happens if the repo is marked as private in GitHub instead of public. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |

### Readme

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Good readme | ```* Your repo includes a good readme. Here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme. You can use this to improve your readme in future projects https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d.``` |
| No readme | ```* You haven’t included a readme in your repo. This is a critical part of any project and here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme.  https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d.``` |
| Readme needs improvement | ```* Your repo contains a readme that could be even better with a few changes.  This is an important part of any project and here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme.  https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d.``` |
| Good readme, but no screenshot/gif | ```* Your readme is good, but could be even better with the addition of a screenshot/gif.  Here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme. You can use this to improve your readme in future projects https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d. ```|
| Readme is generated by a utility | ```* Your readme is the template generated by CRA and could be improved. Here’s additional info to show how to structure a well written readme. You can use this to improve your readme in future projects https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d. ```|

### Commits

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Commits are atomic & commit messages are descriptive | ```* Your commits are atomic and your commit messages are descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Commits are atomic, but commit messages aren’t descriptive | ```* Your commits are atomic, but some commit messages could be more descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Commits aren’t atomic, but commit messages are descriptive | ```* Your commits aren’t atomic, but your commit messages are descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Commits aren’t atomic and commit messages aren’t descriptive | ```* Your commits aren’t atomic and your commit messages could be more descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.``` |
| Files have been uploaded to GitHub rather than by using git | ```* Changes appear to be made directly to GitHub using file uploads. Suggest using git so individual commits/changes can be tracked. Here’s more information on how to use git & GitHub to provide better tracking and change management. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git``` |

### Repo

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Repo is well organized | ```* Your repo is well organized. This is very important since you'll spend more time maintaining an app than writing it. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2. ``` |
| Source code not in `src` directory | ```* I suggest you look at adding source code files to a `src` directory in the root of your repo in future projects. This has little benefit on a project of this size, but for more projects with many source files the organization it adds will make understanding the app easier. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2``` |
| Repo is well organized, but no separate BE & FE subdirectories | ```* Your repo is well organized. But, you can make it even better by adding a `backend` subdirectory for your BE code and a `frontend` subdirectory for your FE code. This is very important since you'll spend more time maintaining an app than writing it. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2. ``` |
| Repo is well organized, but source code is included in a directory that should be merged into the root of the repo | ```* I suggest you move the source code files in the `` directory into the root of your repo in future projects. This directory currently adds an extra, unnecessary directory level to the project and moving it will make understanding the app easier. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2``` |
| Image files not in their own subdirectory	| ```* You can make your repo even more organized by moving your image files into their own subdirectory. For example, `images`.``` |
| Configuration files not in their own subdirectory	| ```* You can make your repo even more organized by moving your configuration files, such as site.webmanifest, into their own subdirectory. For example, assets.``` |
| Additional src file organization required	| ```* You should consider improving the organization of your repo by creating additional subdirectories under the src directory for specific types of functionality. For example, a components subdirectory for page components. This will help you and any contributors to the project quickly and easily locate specific types of files based on their usage.``` |
| `node_modules` directory included in GitHub repo | ```* I suggest adding `node_modules` to `.gitignore` to reduce GitHub repo size. Since this subdirectory is build and managed by NPM from your `package.json` file there’s no advantage to including it in GitHub. However, this is merely a best practice and doesn’t impact how the application runs.``` |
| Update package.json to move `devDependencies` to be adjacent to `dependencies` | ```* In your `package.json` file consider moving `devDependencies` to be adjacent to `dependencies`. This is a minor change, but since the two need to be examined together during troubleshooting it’s something that could be a timesaver.``` |
| Packages are embedded in repo | ```* There are several libraries, like `popper.js` embedded in the repo which will greatly increase bundle size. Consider using a bundler like NPM or versions hosted on CDN's to improve initial page load time. This will also let you take advantage of any fixes and changes made by the vendor without having to redeploy your app. However, it does increase the risk of a breaking change impacting your code.``` |
| Code embedded as script in HTML file | ```* Javascript code is embedded in your HTML file as a <script>. It’s actually a best practice to include code as a separate file that’s referenced by a <script> tag, rather than embedding the code itself. Here’s information describing the situation in detail and how to deal with it https://www.thoughtco.com/moving-javascript-out-of-the-web-page-2037542``` |
| `.env` file included in GitHub repo | ```* App secrets are exposed in plaintext in the `.env` file. A best practice to follow is to add this file to your `.gitignore` so it’s not uploaded to GitHub. https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa ``` |

### HTML/CSS

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Script tag in wrong location | ```* In `index.html`  you might want to move the `<script>` tag to the end of the `<body>` section or to use the `defer` attribute on the `<script>` tag to prevent blocking during initial page load. You can learn more about this option here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-async``` |
| Add defer attribute to script | ```* In `index.html`  you might want to move the `<script>` tag to the end of the `<body>` section or to use the `defer` attribute on the `<script>` tag to prevent blocking during initial page load. You can learn more about this option here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-async``` |
| Good use of semantic HTML | ```* You have made good use of semantic HTML. This is a good best practice to follow since it provides meaning to the elements on the page, which is better than any code comments. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html``` |
| Needs semantic HTML | ```* Your HTML is good, but could be even better by using semantic tags. This is a good best practice to follow since it provides meaning to the elements on the page, which is better than any code comments. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html``` |
| JS embedded in HTML files	| ```* Instead of embedding your Javascript in the HTML files it's an industry best practice to place them in .js files in a src directory in your repo. This doesn't impact the operation of the app, but it makes the code easier to find and troubleshoot. Something you'll appreciate as the app grows in size.``` |
| Large CSS file | ```* Your main CSS file, ``, is quite large. Breaking this up into multiple files, for example one for a master layout and other for individual pages and components, will help make troubleshooting somewhat easier. In addition, separate file names helps to add contextual meaning to their contents.``` |

### Code

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Code is readable & maintainable | ```* Your code is readable & maintainable. This is very important since you'll spend more time maintaining an app than writing it. I guarantee that in just a few weeks you'll forget the details you know today. Anything you can do to improve readability & maintainability is a gift to your "future self". ``` |
| Follows SRP principle | ```* You have done a good job splitting logic into multiple files & functions so that each has a single responsibility. If you are looking for more info on SOLID principles here’s info that may be of interest https://tinyurl.com/yg26bsot``` |
| Doesn’t follow SOLID principles | ```* Consider splitting logic into multiple files & functions so that each has a single responsibility. This won’t have much of an impact on a small app, but it’s a good best practice to get into the habit of following. If you are looking for more info on SOLID principles here’s info that may be of interest https://tinyurl.com/yg26bsot.``` |
| Good use of code comments | ```* Your code comments are very good. They provide additional explanation of the code without making it hard to read. https://www.stepsize.com/blog/the-engineers-guide-to-writing-code-comments``` |
| Some irrelevant comments | ```* Some files contain code comments that are irrelevant (e.g. `server.js`). Although this doesn’t affect how the app runs, it could make reading and debugging the code more difficult.``` |
| Some commented out code | ```* There is some commented out code in your source files (such as in ``).  Even though this doesn’t affect the operation of the app it can make troubleshooting and debugging more difficult.``` |
| Good use of environment variables to protect app secrets | ```* Great job using environment variables to protect app secrets, like API keys. As you know, protecting application secrets isn’t an option and is critical to protecting apps from unscrupulous hackers.``` |
| Sensitive information exposed in `` | ```* Sensitive information, like an API key, is exposed in plaintext in ``. Consider moving these to environment variables.  https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa``` |
| Repeated code	| ```* The itemPrice function is repeated in in both pages/Cart.js  and pages/Pdp.js . In future apps consider extracting this logic into a utility function that can be shared. This is known as the DRY principle ('Don't Repeat Yourself', and it will help make the app easier to maintain and enhance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself``` |
| Database calls issued from FE	| ```* One security concern is you are directly accessing the database from the FE, rather than through a BE app server. This is a security concern since it is impossible to secure browser applications. A more secure approach is to only access your database through an API to a custom backend application server since backend servers can be secured.``` |
| Good error checking | ```* You have done a very good job intercepting and handling errors in a way that provides useful information to maintainers and which allows the app to fail gracefully.``` |
| Insufficient error checking | ```* There is no error checking following your API call in `Dictionary.js`. It is important to intercept and handling errors in a way that provides useful information to maintainers and which allows the app to fail gracefully.``` |
| Needs more descriptive variable names	| ```* Consider using variable & constant names that are more descriptive. This makes the code more readable by adding context, which can be more effective than any code comment. https://www.brainstobytes.com/writing-good-variable-names/``` |
| Good choice of descriptive variable names	| ```* You have done a good job selecting variable & constant names that are descriptive. This makes the code more readable by adding context, which can be more effective than any code comment. https://www.brainstobytes.com/writing-good-variable-names/``` |
| Good use of vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM | ```* Good use of vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM. This is an important skill to master and one that will help when you start to learn FE frameworks like React, VueJS, SvelteJS, etc.``` |
| Project doesn’t contain any scripting language files (e.g. Javascript, Ruby, PHP, Python, etc.) | ```* App shows you understand CSS & HTML, but doesn't contain any scripting such as Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc. Scripting is important in a Voyage. **_Please add something like a floating scroll to top button implemented in JS to one of the pages._** ``` |
| Hardcoded server URL in FE | ```* In `` you have hardcoded the URL to a BE server/service. This can increase maintenance time since a change to a URL will require updates to one or more source files + additional test time. Instead, consider placing URL’s in environment variables so they can be modified with no code changes.``` |
| Good attributions for copied code | ```* Good work including attributions to code copied from other sources. This shows professional courtesy to other Developers and is much appreciated. ``` |
| Used `var` instead of `const/let` | ```* In `script.js` you have used `var` instead of `const/let`. This doesn’t impact how the app runs, but is a good defensive practice to adopt. This article explains the difference between the and why `const/let` are favored over `var` in modern JS. https://tinyurl.com/y5zj33d7``` |
| Nested if’s	| ```* Some `if` statements nested too deeply (some at 3+ levels such as in ``). This can make troubleshooting problems and adding enhancements extremely difficult. One option is to split these into smaller discrete functions.``` |
| Routes, controllers & middleware logic embedded in a single server-side file. | ```* In the BE consider isolating routes, controllers, & middleware logic into separate files in your BE. This doesn’t impact how the app will run, but it will make it easier to enhance and debug as it grows.``` |
| Routes, controllers & middleware logic separated into different files	| ```* In the BE you have done a good job of isolating routes, controllers, & middleware logic into separate files in your BE. This doesn’t impact how the app will run, but it will make it easier to enhance and debug as it grows.``` |
| Hardcoded data embedded in a Javascript file | ```* In `` consider placing the `` array into a separate file and import it to reduce the number of lines in this file. Separating procedural code from declarative data this reduces the number of lines in the file, which can make it easier to read, debug, and enhance.``` |
| Hardcoded data included in separate file | ```* You have done a good job isolating constant data into `` so it can be imported in other files to reduce the number of lines in this file. Separating procedural code from declarative data this reduces the number of lines in the file, which can make it easier to read, debug, and enhance.``` |
| Magic numbers used | ```* You should consider using constants in place of "magic" numbers to provide contextual meaning (e.g. `request: 10000` in `location.js`). This is often better than any code comment. Here's additional info on magic numbers https://jeffreyeverhart.com/2020/09/28/javascript-tips-using-named-constants-for-magic-numbers/#:~:text=What Are Magic Numbers%3F,replaced by a named constant.&text=Date.,-.``` |
| Implemented common code	| ```* Good work implementing your own functions for dealing with date formatting instead of relying on a library. Although there’s nothing wrong with using a library they often contain far more functions than what you need for something like this, which increases your bundle size.``` |
| Switch/case statements | ```* In `` you have made effective use of switch/case statements. But, for future projects consider encoding the information in an array of JS objects and searching to find the desired result. This doesn't improve performance, but it does make for less code and is straightforward to implement.``` |

### Automated Tests

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Good use of automated testing | ```* You have done a good job creating automated tests to validate basic app functionality. Here’s advice from one of my favorite authors for testing JS applications https://testingjavascript.com/```

### Career

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Consider adding professional & social links | ```* Consider adding your social & professional links, like GitHub, Twitter, & LinkedIn, to your webpage. This is especially important if you’ll be sharing this app with potential employers. You want to make it easy for them to learn more about you.``` |
