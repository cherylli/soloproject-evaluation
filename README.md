## Overview

This repo contains a standard list of conditions and feedback for feedback
provided to Chingu's on the [Solo Project](https://chingucohorts.notion.site/Solo-Project-Conditions-Feedback-a2597fbd2f554500ad231aeea189ffb1) they are 
required to submit prior to their first Voyage.

We want our feedback to achieve these goals:

1. Provide feedback to help our Members become better Developers.
2. Provide feedback to help our Members correct issues, but also to encourage
practices we find that they are doing well.
3. Provide feedback that is consistent & fair, regardless of who performs the
Solo Project evaluation.

| Condition | Feedback |
|-----------|----------|
| Passed | Hi @. Congratulations on your hard work and dedication. Your Voyage 45 Solo Project has been accepted and you are advancing to the Voyage Phase starting on August 7th. Watch the <#1026584387569078373> channel for more information. <br/><br/> ```**_If you haven't yet signed up for Voyage 45 complete this form so you don't miss out _** ``` —> https://forms.gle/DajSfXQCX4qbMAu8A <br/><br/>I’m looking forward to seeing what you and your team will be creating in your Voyage! <br/><br/>https://c.tenor.com/bDxOr4tSm7kAAAAC/spongebob-high-five.gif <br/><br/>Here is some more specific feedback which I hope will be helpful: |
| Requested changes | Hi @. Your app shows that you’ve invested a considerable amount of thought and effort in its design & implementation. <br/><br/>Please make the following change and then DM me here when you are ready for me to look at it again. ``` **_This is the only change you are required to make._** ``` <br/><br/>* Requested change #1… <br/><br/>Here’s additional feedback that I hope will be helpful. |
| Requested changes - no deployed URL | I started to review your Solo Project, but you haven’t provided a valid URL for where it’s deployed on the Internet. <br/><br/>We ask for this so we can not only look at your code, but also the running application and it’s UI/UX. In addition, knowing how to deploy to a web host like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Render, etc. is a skill you’ll need in your Voyage. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
| Repo URL not found |	I started to review your Solo Project, but the URL you’ve provided for your repo is not found (HTTP/404). <br/><br/>This often happens if the repo is marked as private in GitHub instead of public. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
